# 🤖 RAG Chatbots Workshop 2025

Welcome to the **RAG Chatbots Workshop 2025**!  
This hands-on workshop aims to build and deploy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbots using educational PDF content on HuggingFace Spaces.

---

## 🎯 Workshop Overview
This workshop is designed to equip participants with the practical skills needed to build and deploy intelligent educational chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:

- Develop a chatbot that uses educator-provided teaching materials (PDFs) as its knowledge base
- Automatically generate a fully deployable chatbot application using Streamlit
- Integrate quantised Hugging Face models to run the chatbot efficiently in the browser
- Control the complexity level of responses and display source references for transparency

In addition, this workshop introduces participants to core techniques in:

- Prompt engineering
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Working with Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Building front-end interfaces using the Streamlit API
---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🧠 **Hugging Face Models** (quantised)
- 🧵 **LangChain**
- 🧪 **Streamlit**
- 💬 **ChromaDB** or **FAISS**
- 📄 Your uploaded **PDFs**
- 🧠 Custom **Embeddings**

## 🛠️ How the System Works

Based on the educators' inputs (PDF files, preferred complexity, etc.), the generator automatically creates:
- `app.py`: A Streamlit-based chatbot app
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies
- Your uploaded PDFs as the chatbot’s knowledge base

They also get:
- A **setup manual** for getting API tokens, configuring hardware on Hugging Face Spaces, and deploying the chatbot

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Retrieves answers **only** from your PDFs
- Responds with **source documents** for transparency
- Handles greetings and simple conversations
- Offers **multiple complexity levels** for answers
- Can ask **follow-up questions** to the user
- Supports small (quantised) models for faster inference

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Ideal For:

Educators, researchers, and content creators who want to:
- Build chatbots for their teaching content
- Integrate AI in their curriculum
- Use open-source tools with minimal setup
