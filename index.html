# 🤖 RAG Chatbots Workshop 2025

Welcome to the **RAG Chatbots Workshop 2025**!  
This hands-on workshop empowers educators to build and deploy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbots using their own PDF content.

---

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to:
- Build a chatbot that uses your teaching materials as its knowledge base
- Automatically generate a deployable chatbot app using Streamlit
- Use quantised Hugging Face models to run your chatbot in the browser
- Control the response complexity and retrieve sources for transparency

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🧠 **Hugging Face Models** (quantised)
- 🧵 **LangChain**
- 🧪 **Streamlit**
- 💬 **ChromaDB** or **FAISS**
- 📄 Your uploaded **PDFs**
- 🧠 Custom **Embeddings**

- 📘 [View the Intro Notebook (nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.org/github/noorhanabbas/RAGChatbots_Workshop2025/blob/main/Notebooks/rag_intro.ipynb)
- 📝 [Explore the Code on GitHub](https://github.com/noorhanabbas/RAGChatbots_Workshop2025)
- 🤖 [Coming Soon: Live Chatbot on Hugging Face Spaces](#)

---

## 🛠️ How the System Works

Based on your inputs (PDF files, preferred complexity, etc.), the generator automatically creates:
- `app.py`: A Streamlit-based chatbot app
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies
- Your uploaded PDFs as the chatbot’s knowledge base

You also get:
- A **setup manual** for getting API tokens, configuring hardware on Hugging Face Spaces, and deploying the chatbot

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Retrieves answers **only** from your PDFs
- Responds with **source documents** for transparency
- Handles greetings and simple conversations
- Offers **multiple complexity levels** for answers
- Can ask **follow-up questions** to the user
- Supports small (quantised) models for faster inference

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Ideal For:

Educators, researchers, and content creators who want to:
- Build chatbots for their teaching content
- Integrate AI in their curriculum
- Use open-source tools with minimal setup
